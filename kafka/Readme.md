# What is Kafka

Kafka is a distributed data store optimized for ingesting and processing streaming data in real-time. Streaming data is data that is continuously generated by thousands of data sources, which typically send the data records in simultaneously. A streaming platform needs to handle this constant influx of data, and process the data sequentially and incrementally.

### Kafka provides three main functions to its users:

1. Publish and subscribe to streams of records
2. Effectively store streams of records in the order in which records were generated
3. Process streams of records in real time

Kafka is primarily used to build real-time streaming data pipelines and applications that adapt to the data streams. It combines messaging, storage, and stream processing to allow storage and analysis of both historical and real-time data.

Kafka Provides a Producer and Consumer. A producer is also knows as a log / message writer onto the stream, whereas the consumer is reader of the logs. As a consumer consumer / reads a log it commit it and moves to the nest message, multiple consumer have an option to read the same logs and commit it for themself without creating any hurdle for other consumers.

### Kafka Offers 2 messaging models:

1. Queueing
2. Pub / Sub
